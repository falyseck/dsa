This project implements a Sparse Matrix class in Python that supports:
-Matrix Addition
-Matrix Subtraction
-Matrix Multiplication
-File Input/Output Handling
-User Interaction for Matrix Operations

The program reads matrices from text files and allows users to perform operations through an interactive menu.

I used Git Large File Storage (LFS) to manage the large files for them to be pushed to my github.
